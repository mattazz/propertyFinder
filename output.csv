THE RISE by Shangri la MAKATI located in the burgeoning North Makati District (NOMA) combines celebrated world-class architecture and interior design with Shang Properties’ signature build quality to create a one-of-a-kind residential and commercial development.

THE RISE MAKATI has an area of 10,825 square meters of development which will have an iconic propeller design consisting of three wings/towers joined as one by a central core thereby allowing the condominium units to maximize the view, spaces, and amenities. The project also has a 2-story mall located on the ground and 2nd floors with over 51 restaurants and shops (not the usual restaurants and shops – to be a destination mall) and more than 7,000 square meters of spaces and amenities.

3 GREAT REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD MOVE TO MAKATI CITY:

1. Your workplace is at your doorstep
Anyone who has ever rented a condo in Makati CBD will tell you how convenient it is to have your office a few steps away from home. It saves you a lot of time, trouble, and even money for transportation. One bonus in having your workplace near home helps you evade the stress of dealing with Metro Manila’s rush-hour traffic, especially with the impending closure of Buendia Avenue for the construction of an underpass.

2. Beneath the hustle and bustle, there is a sense of community in Makati CBD
Most business districts abroad have a reputation of being steely and impersonal, but not the Makati CBD. The cities’ communities like Salcedo Village and Legaspi Village are thriving, hip, trendy neighborhoods that are ideal residences for yuppies who want a place to mingle and socialize. Explore any of the pubs peppered along its streets and discover hole-in-the-wall restaurants where you and your folks can relish the unique dining experiences it offers.

3. Everything you will ever need is here
Landing a spot in Makati will not only give you easy access to your own work but will also provide access to just about everything. From a wide selection of restaurants, weekend markets, shopping centers, and parks with lush greenery, to the best medical facilities and top-tier schools, owning a condo in Makati CBD makes sure that you are a stone’s throw away from it all.

The cities communities like Salcedo Village and Legaspi Village are thriving, hip, trendy neighborhoods that are ideal residences for yuppies who want a place to mingle and socialize.

6 Reasons to Live in San Antonio, Makati
1. Proximity to the Makati CBD
The astronomical rent in prime addresses within the Makati central business district (CBD) is neither a mystery nor a secret. Even teeny tiny units in ancient residential buildings are no exception by virtue of them being close to the hotspots. “’Yung location lang talaga ‘yung binabayaran mo,” a friend who used to live in one of the old condominiums right across a popular park would say.
2. It is commute-friendly
If you don’t have a car or couldn’t afford to Uber your way to the office every single day, living in SAV will present you with several options you could take if you’re not too finicky about public transportations. Where I used to live, sometimes I would take a short tricycle ride or a long walk to the corner of Mayapis Street and Gil Puyat Avenue, to the jeepney terminal plying the MRT Buendia-Washington route. I would get off right in front of the building where I used to work, which is at the corner of Makati Avenue.
3. It has the comforts of home and good security
My former landlady would always make it a point to praise SAV’s good security considering that it’s not really a village in the exclusive sense of the word. Its gates close to public vehicles at a certain time, the neighborhood is quiet, and (at least in the part of SAV where I had stayed) the streets were well-lit and well guarded enough for me to sometimes venture into a long walk home at midnight. I certainly would have quit halfway or not repeat the same feat had I felt security was lacking.
4. There are both houses and high-rises
What also adds to San Antonio Village’s charm and balance is the mix of old family houses, newly built low-rise apartment blocks or townhouse units, and a few high-rise condominiums in choice spots like Filinvest’s The Linear in Mayapis corner Malugay and Yakal streets, and Avida Land’s Asten Towers along Malugay street.
5. This part of Makati is close to Manila
Since San Antonio Village is in the outskirts of Makati City and Manila, some of its major roads run from SAV to Manila. This proximity to the old city adds a whole dimension of options for shopping, dining, and recreational spots. Spend a cozy afternoon with your kids at the Paco Park, go see an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, rediscover Intramuros, or do a food crawl in Binondo.
In a bigger context, the strategic location also allows for more options when it comes to schools and hospitals.
6. It has dining spots for all budgets
SAV is no slouch in the resto scene. More importantly, it boasts of homegrown gems that are easy to love. Many late nights, I would turn to the 24-hour Goto Monster for a filling and comforting bowl of goto with my favorite side order of talong chips."

Kroma Tower is Alveo Land's newest and hottest mixed-use high-rise development in the Makati Central Business District (MCBD). Located along the energetic Dela Rosa Street, Kroma Tower pumps up urban lifestyles with proximity and access to the city's power core, space-efficient units, and sleek amenities, including a rooftop enterprise lounge with killer city views.

About Kroma Tower:  Meeting All Expectations
Kroma Tower by Alveo Land is an excellent property find.  This is considering how difficult it is these days to find a good sized Makati condo unit in a building less than five years old, and have it conveniently Â located meters away from the CBD's prestigious offices and chic restaurants.  Indeed, Kroma Tower in Legaspi Village, Makati City  meets these points square on.
Why Kroma Tower is a perfect choice for you.
There is hardly anything lacking in this development. It has it all.
This mixed-use project stands tall along Dela Rosa Avenue in Legaspi Village, Makati City from where multiple places of interest are accessible.  You simply have to turn the corner to reach Ayala Avenue. A few more steps and neighboring Salcedo Village is within reach. There is no need to look for a parking spot or maneuver around one way streets.
If you are an investor and attracted to the frenetic vibe Makati generates, then a Kroma Tower for sale unit might just be for you. It has five different unit types ranging from 27 square meters to 130 square meters. These are also competitively priced considering its location. Units could be priced anywhere between PhP8.2 million to PhP30 million depending on its size and interior design. This would come out to about PhP122,500 to PhP273,000 per sq.m.
Should you be in the market for a Kroma Tower for rent unit and find one available, grab it. Having the opportunity to live in this mixed use development with all its perks is surely a bargain."

Kroma Tower is Alveo Land's newest and hottest mixed-use high-rise development in the Makati Central Business District (MCBD). Located along the energetic Dela Rosa Street, Kroma Tower pumps up urban lifestyles with proximity and access to the city's power core, space-efficient units, and sleek amenities, including a rooftop enterprise lounge with killer city views.

About Kroma Tower:  Meeting All Expectations
Kroma Tower by Alveo Land is an excellent property find.  This is considering how difficult it is these days to find a good sized Makati condo unit in a building less than five years old, and have it conveniently Â located meters away from the CBD's prestigious offices and chic restaurants.  Indeed, Kroma Tower in Legaspi Village, Makati City  meets these points square on.
Why Kroma Tower is a perfect choice for you.
There is hardly anything lacking in this development. It has it all.
This mixed-use project stands tall along Dela Rosa Avenue in Legaspi Village, Makati City from where multiple places of interest are accessible.  You simply have to turn the corner to reach Ayala Avenue. A few more steps and neighboring Salcedo Village is within reach. There is no need to look for a parking spot or maneuver around one way streets.
If you are an investor and attracted to the frenetic vibe Makati generates, then a Kroma Tower for sale unit might just be for you. It has five different unit types ranging from 27 square meters to 130 square meters. These are also competitively priced considering its location. Units could be priced anywhere between PhP8.2 million to PhP30 million depending on its size and interior design. This would come out to about PhP122,500 to PhP273,000 per sq.m.
Should you be in the market for a Kroma Tower for rent unit and find one available, grab it. Having the opportunity to live in this mixed use development with all its perks is surely a bargain."
