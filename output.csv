AYALA ALABANG VILLAGE remains the most sought-after residential subdivision in the south or Metro Manila because of its prime location, first-class facilities, and easy accessibility to the business districts of Muntinlupa City, Makati City and Laguna. It is also just a stone-throw away from the high-end shopping haven Alabang Town Center, Molito and Festival Mall. With an area of approximately 700 hectares, this sprawling subdivision is by far the most exclusive subdivision and most secured enclave in Metro Manila. Ayala Alabang Village is accessible via Skyway, South Luzon Expressway (exit to Alabang or Filinvest) and Zapote Alabang Road. It is a 20-minute drive from Makati and just a few minutes drive from the NAIA International and domestic airports. It is also a gateway to other places of interest in the South of Metro Manila.

4 GREAT REASON WHY LIVE IN MUNTINLUPA CITY?

1. Proximity and Accessibility
Muntinlupa connects to multiple cities in Metro Manila with various routes and highways. With many available options for transportation, the means of getting to your desired destination won’t be too difficult. Residents of Muntinlupa can choose either the South Luzon Expressway (SLEX), C5 and C6 Roads, and the Skyway to ease their commute to busy cities like Makati and Taguig. A quick trip to Cavite is possible via Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway (MCX). Residents bound to Pasay can also go through SLEX or Skyway.

2. Living in Convenience
Muntinlupa is a good choice for your residence and an ideal location for a lucrative property investment. While the proximity to important places can already provide residents with convenience in traveling from their homes to their workplaces and other locations, residents can also avail of amenities within the community for leisure and recreation.

3. A Booming Business District
Alabang has since grown into a progressive business district. Attracting several foreign and local businesses to set up offices in the locality, Muntinlupa has allowed for the growth of a business district that can compete with its neighboring cities in the metro. As economic development becomes a factor for businesses to grow, investing a home in Muntinlupa means a potential access to employment and entrepreneurial opportunities.

4.  A Progressive Green City
In spite of being an urban city, Muntinlupa has managed to curb its carbon footprint by implementing measures such as choosing electric public utility vehicles over conventional ones and building green algae farms for research.

Alabang is a lively business district and transport hub, with stations for commuter trains and intercity buses around Starmall shopping center. Alabang leads the way as the go-to hangout place every weekend for many families living down south. A number of companies have taken residence at its vast commercial spaces, but do not disrupt the relaxed community vibe that Alabang has long been known for. Life down Alabang would never get monotonous with its many parks to visit for morning walks, indoor and outdoor malls to shop, and a long list of bazaars to look forward to throughout the year.

WHY COMMECIAL PROPERTY IS A GOOD INVESTMENT?

1. Higher income yields – commercial properties generally show a greater level of income for a given property value, when compared to residential property.

2. Capital growth potential is based on income growth potential and other measurable factors
– commercial properties are often valued on the basis of the potential (and actual) rental return being achieved. Other relevant factors include economic activity, interest rates, and the commercial success of the area surrounding the property.

3. Stability and consistency of income – longer leases. Whilst residential properties are typically held on short leases (often 12 months), commercial properties typically attract longer lease terms between three and 10 years, providing consistent and predictable income streams over time.

4. Income growth – the longer leases of commercial properties usually allow for the rent to increase in every year of the lease, thus increasing the return on investment as the lease progresses.

5. Maintenance – unlike residential investors, commercial investors have the potential to earn enhanced profit, with the lessee responsible for paying the cost of maintenance, rates and repairs on the property when the ongoing expenses are written into the commercial lease agreement.
